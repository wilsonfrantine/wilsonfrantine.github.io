    "about.content2": "<p>For nearly two decades, I have been helping professionals and researchers implement innovative data analysis solutions across various fields. During this time, I have had the privilege of collaborating with leading institutions such as <a href='https://ufu.br' target='_blank'>UFU</a>, <a href='http://uenf.br' target='_blank'>UENF</a>, <a href='https://uel.br' target='_blank'>UEL</a>, and <a href='https://ucdavis.edu' target='_blank'>UC Davis (CA)</a>, working on projects ranging from population genetics to ecological modeling, all with the goal of understanding and protecting biodiversity.</p>",
    
    "about.content3": "<p>Currently, I'm a professor at the <a href='https://uenp.edu.br' target='_blank'>State University of Northern ParanÃ¡ (UENP), CornÃ©lio ProcÃ³pio Campus</a>, where I teach Zoology, Genetics, and Biostatistics.</p> <p>My research focuses on how environmental factors influence the evolution of animal species â€“ from fish and bees to humans. I believe that integrating diverse fields of study is key to understanding and preserving biodiversity in our ever-changing world.</p> <p>If you're looking for project support, consulting, or collaboration, I'd love to connect. <a href='#contact'><b>Let's talk!</b></a></p>",
